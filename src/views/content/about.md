## About

Superset reads Strength Training workout data recorded by the WearOS [Google Fit - Fitness Tracking](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness) app and aims to present that data in more useful ways than Google's own Fit apps.

If you have an Android WearOS watch and this is news to you, here are [some instructions](https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/24/google-fit-v1-64-for-wear-2-0-can-now-identify-strength-training-exercises-and-automatically-count-reps-apk-download/) for gathering this data.
